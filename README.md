> This is an unfinished and scrapped version with my own player implementation, made before the project was moved to [Lucas Rodrigues](https://github.com/marmitoTH)' and [Oplexitie](https://github.com/Oplexitie)'s [Godotnik Land](https://github.com/Oplexitie/Godotnik-Land) framework.
> </br> Repository for the new version: COMING SOON

A Sonic the Hedgehog fangame made in Godot taking inspiration from Sonic Advance 2 and Sonic Rush.
