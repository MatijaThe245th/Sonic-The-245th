![Logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b36fd621-3e2f-4c80-8b79-3c3d7bbba394)

> This is an unfinished and scrapped version with my own player implementation, made before the project was moved to [Oplexitie](https://github.com/Oplexitie)'s [Godotnik Land](https://github.com/Oplexitie/Godotnik-Land) framework.
> </br> Repository for the new version:

A Sonic the Hedgehog fangame made in Godot taking inspiration from Sonic Advance 2 and Sonic Rush.
